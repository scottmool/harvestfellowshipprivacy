Welcome to the Harvest Fellowship app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Scott Mool. The app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

This website was not created to collect any personally identifiable information. All data collection through this site is initiated by the user in the making of a contact request.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how to protect your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Scott Mool
